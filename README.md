- 🤖 Hi, I’m @Labanazario, a software developer/publisher and mentor in the IT field. I am focused on Mobile Apps, specifically Android Apps.
- ☕ Moved by coffee most of the time, I'm interested in AI Research and Machine Learning to bring apps a more versatile way of use
- 🌱 I’m currently working on the development of AI-related software and training people to manage their digital businesses
- 💞️ My goal is to build my own AI Model, which I started engineering from scratch as a teenager in 2014. Maybe someday I will succeed in this.
- 😊 By now, there are a lot of things to learn. Always learn from the trees; they're always spreading their root, seeking nutrients, so seek knowledge and wisdom as a tree and never stop growing.
